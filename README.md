# MECH105 Algorithms

This repository contains the algorithms that I wrote for MECH105 (Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving) using various numerical methods we learned throughout the course. I took and completed this course in the spring semester of 2021. 

### Algorithms
- [False Position](https://github.com/bslaught1/MECH105-Algorithms/tree/main/FalsePosition)
  - A bracketing root finding algorithm
- [L U Factorization](https://github.com/bslaught1/MECH105-Algorithms/tree/main/LUFactor)
  - A linear algebra matrix factoring algorithm
- [Simpson's 1/3 Rule](https://github.com/bslaught1/MECH105-Algorithms/tree/main/Simpson)
  - A numerical integration algorithm
